---


Hi, people from the **Apropos** group. This post will share tips and information about our summer school in Valencia, Spain.
This information is mainly about traveling, eating, and exploring.

## ‚úàÔ∏è To get to Valencia 
You can travel to Valencia via flights directly to Valencia.
You can also travel to neighboring cities such as Madrid, Barcelona, and Alicante then travel to Valencia via train.

## üè† Accommodation suggestions
Accommodation, book as soon as possible because the stay expands over 5 days, which is challenging to find a room with these consecutive days. 

Avoid Airbnb near the beach; At least 2 KM away from the beach.

In the event of an emergency, call 112.

Valencia is a city with a wide range of public transportation options and coverage.

## ‚úàÔ∏è You just arrived in Valencia.
After arriving at the airport, you can take a bus or metro to the city centre. 
External links: [HERE](https://www.valencia-cityguide.com/tourist-information/transport/transport-from-the-airport-to-the-city.html)

I would recommend taking the metro to get to the centre. 
Like most of the city, the airport is in an extra charging zone of the metro network.  

You can also choose to purchase a **SUMA10-ABC** tickets, this is a 10 trips ticket can be used in zone ABC, bus, tram and metro. The price is ‚Ç¨21.  
The 10 trips have long-term validation. 


 **To buy **an** ABC ticket just easier** for a short-term visitor.

## üèôÔ∏è You are in the city centre.

You can purchase **SUMA10-A** tickets that contain **10 trips** valid on **metro**, tram, and bus in zone A. The price is ‚Ç¨8.

You can get this ticket from metro and tram stations.
