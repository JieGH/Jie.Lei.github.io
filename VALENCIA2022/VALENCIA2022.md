## 💶 Spending and currency 
The currency is euro. 
It’s **recommended to have cash** with you.
For some rare cases, you need it to bus bus ticket or purchasing tram tickets from the broken cash only ticket machine. 
In most of cases, card is enough.

## Public transportation 

Valencia is a city with wide range of public transportation options and coverage. 

---

## ✈️ You just arrived in Valencia.

After arriving the airport. You can take bus or metro to the city centre. 
External links: [HERE](https://www.valencia-cityguide.com/tourist-information/transport/transport-from-the-airport-to-the-city.html)

I would recommend talking metro to get to the centre. 
Like most of city, the airport is in a extra charging zone of metro network. When leaving and arriving to the airport, make sure you purchase a single airport ticket. 

You can also choose to purchase a **SUMA10-ABC** tickets, this is a 10 trips ticket can be used in zone ABC, bus, tram and metro. Price is €21.  
The 10 trips has long term validation. 

This is usually not necessary since airport is the only stop in zone C. You would less likely go to zone c during your stay.  
But a single airport ticket is €6   
So. **To buy a ABC ticket just easier for short tern visiter.**


About **SUMA-10** [here]( https://www.metrovalencia.es/en/communications/what-is-suma/)

## 🏙️ You are in the city centre.

You can purchase **SUMA10-A** tickets that contains **10 trips** valid on **metro, tram and bus in zone A**.  
Price is €8.
SUMA-10 ticket can be shared by multiple people, scan ticket twice means you paid two trip for two person. 
This ticket is not valid from and to airport. 
You can get this ticket from metro and tram stations.
