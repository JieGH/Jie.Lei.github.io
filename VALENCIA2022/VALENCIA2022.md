## ‚úàÔ∏è To get to Valencia 
You can travel to Valencia via flights directly to Valencia.
You can also travel to neighboring cities such as Madrid, Barcelona, and Alicante then travel to Valencia via train. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## üè† Accommodation suggestions
Accommodation, book as soon as possible because the stay expands over 5 days, which is challenging to find a room with these consecutive days. 

Event will start from the Morning of 26/09/2022 to the Evening of 30/09/2022.

Avoid Airbnb near the beach; At least 2 KM away from the beach.

## üí∂ Spending and currency 
The currency is the euro. 
It‚Äôs **recommended to have cash** with you.
In some rare cases, you need it to buy bus tickets or tram tickets from the broken cash-only ticket machine. In most cases, card is enough.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## ‚úàÔ∏è You just arrived in Valencia.
After arriving at the airport, you can take a bus or metro to the city centre. 
External links: [HERE](https://www.valencia-cityguide.com/tourist-information/transport/transport-from-the-airport-to-the-city.html)

I would recommend taking the metro to get to the centre. 
Like most of the city, the airport is in an extra charging zone of the metro network.  

You can also choose to purchase a **SUMA10-ABC** tickets, this is a 10 trips ticket can be used in zone ABC, bus, tram and metro. The price is ‚Ç¨21.  
The 10 trips have long-term validation. 


 **To buy **an** ABC ticket just easier** for a short-term visitor.

If you have SUMA-10, you can use it on these three transportation methods.
